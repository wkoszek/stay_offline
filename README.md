# Stay Offline and Study

This repository has scripts which will make you more productive.
They let you download content from valuable websites in a batch form (all
content at once) and format it in a way easy to read offline.
This stuff has been tested on iPad Pro, which is my primary reading
platform.

I don't support illegal scrubbing etc., so just submit convenience scripts
for websites which have valueable content, and are free, without a need to
"hack" the website.

If you want to support offline website with a paid content, remember to make
script be parametrizable, and remove the login/password credentials before
submitting stuff here.


**Example**: NSScreencasts are nice,
but don't support offline mode well. So `nsscreencast/` has a script which
will take your user name and password.
