# Stay Offline and Study

This repo holds scripts making studying offline easier. Whatever lets you
get audio/video/lectures for offline studying, feel free to share and submit
pull requests.

I don't support illegal scrubbing etc., so just submit convenience scripts
for websites which have valueable content, and are free, but are hard to get
for offline reading. Same for paid websites, but you must provide stuff for
dealing with password/membership handling. Example: NSScreencasts are nice,
but don't support offline mode well. So below is the script to which you
pass username/password, and it lets you get the videos for your viewing.

## Currently supported

**NSScreencasts**:

- download-nsscreencast.rb
  - You'll have to provide username and password to get the videos.
